## Part 2

The following [link](https://www.farfetch.com/uk/plpslice/listing-api/query?setId=9645&view=180&gender=Men) is a REST API endpoint which contains real-time data for our New In Menswear Set.

Please create a JS application which will output products from this feed. Output these products with images; 2 column for mobile and 3 for tablet/desktop using the breakpoint 960px.

Bonus points for:

- Including designer name, description, anchor and hover image of product.
- Add a filter which allows the user to select the brands available within the feed.

Upon completion please store these tasks in a repository and provide us with the link.
